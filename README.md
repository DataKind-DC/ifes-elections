# IFES Elections Data Visualization

- Documentation.
- Source: Election Guide.
- Objective: timelines.
- Brainstorm motivating questions.
- Country specific timelines for transparency.
- Archetype, comparative timelines, and outliers.
- Measure days until election or inauguration.
- Create interactive dashboards.
- Start rough and iterate.
- Connect with the group (Slack, etc).
- How to contribute.
- Contact Bailey Binman.


## Background

Elections are essential for everyday people to influence the decisions that
affect their lives. For elections to succeed, election boards, monitors, and
other stakeholders need resources to support effective and inclusive practices.
They also need to be identify and address election vulnerabilities.

Timing is important to both of these efforts. Although many of us are familiar
with the campaigning and voting of elections, many critical stages in the
electoral cycle occur long before or after election day. Stakeholders need to
know when these stages occur, so that they can support elections at each stage.

The [International Foundation for Electoral Systems](https://www.ifes.org/)
(IFES) works with civil society, public institutions, and the private sector to
support free and fair elections around the world. They are partnering with
[DataKind DC](https://www.datakind.org/chapters/datakind-dc) to better
understand the timing of these stages, both for individual elections and in the
aggregate. This collaboration will help stakeholders consider:

- When will donations have the greatest impact?
- When are elections most at risk, and when is the time to act?

The result will provide insights about the timing of electoral cycles around the
world, and it will use visuals to make those insights available to IFES staff,
election officials, donors, academics, and the public at
[electionguide.org](https://www.electionguide.org/).


## Deliverables
Insert key questions that the project is supposed to answer. Ideally we should also include information about the skillset needed and/or if the task is beginner friendly

## Data
A short introduction of the data set used. The main subections of this section should be focus on how to access the data as well as general onboarding.

### Onboarding
A detailed but simple explaination to get ahold of the data. Not only that but there should also be a focus on making sure the end users have the proper libraries installed.

#### Configuration
After retrieving the data, it is important to set up the development environment for reproducible analysis. Before diving into the data, please make sure you configure the following:
- a Python3+ virtualenv, if you are unsure what this means, please refer to [virtualenv](virtualenv-pip-lib.com)
- install the Python management system, [pip](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/)
- install the following Python libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt -c constraints.txt`
- Considerations for deliverables:
  - For deliverable 1: please make sure you do ....
  - etc.

The previous steps assumes working with Python. Other environments to consider for may be R, Node.js, Julia, GoLang, etc.

### Datasets
Here we list the datasets used in detail. Possibly a discussion of columns and certain caveats (anonymizing, cleaning, etc.) can be discussed. Ideally, we should link to the deliverables that the data set aims to answer.

## Phases
Phases usually follow this lifecycle. It may vary from project to project but the general phases
- [Research and Design](#research-and-design)
- [Testing and Implementation](#testing-and-implementation)
- [Feedback and Wrap-up](#feedback-and-wrap-up)
