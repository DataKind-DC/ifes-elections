# IFES Elections Data Visualization

- IFES works with stakeholders for elections.
- Documentation.
- Tables to visuals.
- Source: Election Guide.
- Objective: timelines.
- Elections have commonly recognized phases.
- Important phases are often overlooked.
- Brainstorm motivating questions.
- When are vulnerabilities? When can you help?
- When are high levels of activity (peak need)?
- Country specific timelines for transparency.
- Archetype, comparative timelines, and outliers.
- Times to create mischief (registration, procurement, lame duck).
- Times to support free and fair elections.
- Measure days until election or inauguration.
- Audience: IFES staff, election boards, donors, academics.
- Create interactive dashboards.
- Start rough and iterate.
- UN Circle.
- Connect with the group (Slack, etc).
- How to contribute.
- Contact Bailey Binman.


## Background
Insert a quick blurb about the project. This is possibly where we have a project summary or the objectives
of the project.

## Table of Contents
- [Team Members](#team-members)
- [Deliverables](#deliverables)
- [Data](#data)
- [Project Phases](#phases)

## Team Members
- Name of Member
  - Role (either DA, Core Volunteer, Stakeholder, etc.)
  - Personal Email
  - Contact Phone (?)
  - Miscellaneous information such as contact for certain problems

## Deliverables
Insert key questions that the project is supposed to answer. Ideally we should also include information about the skillset needed and/or if the task is beginner friendly

## Data
A short introduction of the data set used. The main subections of this section should be focus on how to access the data as well as general onboarding.

### Onboarding
A detailed but simple explaination to get ahold of the data. Not only that but there should also be a focus on making sure the end users have the proper libraries installed.

#### Configuration
After retrieving the data, it is important to set up the development environment for reproducible analysis. Before diving into the data, please make sure you configure the following:
- a Python3+ virtualenv, if you are unsure what this means, please refer to [virtualenv](virtualenv-pip-lib.com)
- install the Python management system, [pip](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/)
- install the following Python libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt -c constraints.txt`
- Considerations for deliverables:
  - For deliverable 1: please make sure you do ....
  - etc.

The previous steps assumes working with Python. Other environments to consider for may be R, Node.js, Julia, GoLang, etc.

### Datasets
Here we list the datasets used in detail. Possibly a discussion of columns and certain caveats (anonymizing, cleaning, etc.) can be discussed. Ideally, we should link to the deliverables that the data set aims to answer.

## Phases
Phases usually follow this lifecycle. It may vary from project to project but the general phases
- [Research and Design](#research-and-design)
- [Testing and Implementation](#testing-and-implementation)
- [Feedback and Wrap-up](#feedback-and-wrap-up)
