## Background

Elections are essential for everyday people to influence the decisions that
affect their lives. For elections to succeed, election boards, monitors, and
other stakeholders need resources to support effective and inclusive practices.
They also need to be identify and address election vulnerabilities.

Timing is important to both of these efforts. Although many of us are familiar
with the campaigning and voting of elections, many critical stages in the
electoral cycle occur long before or after election day. Stakeholders need to
know when these stages occur, so that they can support elections at each stage.

The [International Foundation for Electoral Systems](https://www.ifes.org/)
(IFES) works with civil society, public institutions, and the private sector to
support free and fair elections around the world. They are partnering with
[DataKind DC](https://www.datakind.org/chapters/datakind-dc) to better
understand the timing of these stages, both for individual elections and in the
aggregate. This collaboration will help stakeholders consider:

- When will donations have the greatest impact?
- When are elections most at risk, and when is the time to act?

The result will provide insights about the timing of electoral cycles around the
world, and it will use visuals to make those insights available to IFES staff,
election officials, donors, academics, and the public at
[electionguide.org](https://www.electionguide.org/).


## Documentation

Stay tuned for project documentation.


## Objective and Outcomes

We aim to characterize the timing of electoral cycles around the world.

Although each election is different, most elections have common phases like
candidate registration, election day, and dispute resolution. We will use
historical election data from IFES to identify when these phases start and end
for individual countries and elections. We will also aggregate these timelines
to characterize archetypal elections. Some specific questions:

- How long are different election phases?
- How long before election day or inauguration do they occur?
- At what time of year do they occur?
- How frequently do they occur over time?

Our first deliverables will be rough, iterative visuals. These visuals will help
us identify key insights about electoral cycles and experiment with effective
presentation methods.

The final deliverable will polish the initial visuals and present them through
an interactive user interface, possibly hosted on
[electionguide.org](https://www.electionguide.org/).


## Data

Data will come from [electionguide.org](https://www.electionguide.org/), the
IFES election data clearinghouse. Stay tuned for details on the API and
specific sources and fields of interest.
